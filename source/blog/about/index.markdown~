I am an Electrical Engineer who has spent most of my career writing software.  I am originally from Atlanta but I headed west after getting my degree.  I packed up my VW van and drove to Los Angeles where I still live today.

My engineering background has allowed me to enter the world of Motion Control and Robotics.  There has been so many advancements in this field that it makes my head spin.  Back in the old days, motion control was done with micro controllers like the venerable 8051.  You would typically develop your own command set and communicate over a RS-232 or RS-485 serial port.
But now there are so many options and technologies and the hardware cheap and accessible. Today, computers can be had for pennies and software is ubiquitous.  So what does that have to do with me?  When I look back on it, I could never have believed that such technology would have been accessible to me.  I could never have guessed that I would have acquired so many tools and so much knowledge as I have today.  I am not unique, all of my colleagues have had to do the same.  That is one of the great things about engineering.  The learning never ends.-

What in the world am I (a motion guy) doing writing a blog?  Like I have said, there are so many technologies to learn.  Web design is one of them.  Devices today are connected to the Internet and they are getting smarter every day.  The 'Internet of Things' or IoT is the latest buzzword.  Thus, I have learned about web servers and web pages.  I have been looking for a way to document the things that I have learned and ideas that I have had.  This blog seems like the perfect way for me to express myself in an organized way.  It is my diary.  It also provides the added benefit that you, dear reader, may benefit from my experiences and gained knowledge or perhaps you may leave a comment with your own insights or even connect with me and collaborate on something new and interesting.
